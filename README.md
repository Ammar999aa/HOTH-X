# Travel Cost Estimator

This is a hackathon project by Ammar Almarzooq, Lamar Tuker, and Abdulaziz Al Jaloud.

## Goal

To create a program that takes user travel plan information and outputs the estimated cost of the trip. The cost will depend on the means of travel (car, plane…), hotel costs, food, duration of stay, geographical location, etc. The data is gathered from the web.

## Methodology

Using web scrapers and/or API’s to gather the data.
